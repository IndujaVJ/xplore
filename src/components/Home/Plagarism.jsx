  PLAGAIRISM GAURANTEE
      </h2>

      <p>Plagiarism is one of the things, we in our business don&#39;t accept. Our skilled, disciplined writers still write papers from scratch. We run several qualified plagiarism testing systems which will never miss a plagiarized paper to ensure our customers health. We respect the time and resources of our clients and we aim to provide them with high-quality, non-plagiarized documents.</p>

      <p>The cost of plagiarism screening is now part of the overall cost of your order. You may also apply for a (150/ page) plagiarism report to be submitted along with your article. It is a document that demonstrates the originality of the paper as a whole and can be useful if you need to give any officials proof of the originality of your paper.</p>

      <p>There are few exceptions to Plagiarism-free Guarantee. It does not include the proofreading and editing instructions. It is only when our authors write the paper from scratch that our company will offer plagiarism free papers to clients. When clients send us a paper already written to proofread or rewrite, we cannot be sure that the text given has not been plagiarized in advance.</p>

      <p>Where a customer declares a paper plagiarized and offers proof from Turnitin.com, he or she may request that the paper be updated for free. If he / she is a chosen writer or it can be delegated to another writer, the paper may be revised by the same writer.</p>

      <p>In any case, we seldom have plagiarism problems, but that is easily fixed when we do. Our mission is to keep you satisfied and pleased with our services, as long as you are with us.</p>
