      <h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>

      <p>It’s no secret that websites use a certain kind of web technology to collect user data, and we are no exception. Here we want to describe how this all works.</p>

      <h4>COOKIES FROM INSIDE</h4>

      <p>In a nutshell a Cookie file is a tiny text file that our website sends to your computer. There are two main types of cookie files: session based, those which self-delete after you close your browser and persistent Cookies, those that remain on your PC unless you delete them manually, which is super easy, by the by.</p>

Check out here for more details.

      <h4>IS IT OF ANY USE TO US?</h4>

      <p>Yes, but not the way you may think. These minuscule files are only good for statistics and future user experience improvements. Mostly Cookies are used to keep you from logging in to a service over and over again, simple really.</p>

We use Cookies to make your experience with the service more secure and easy.

      <h4>COOKIES IN ADS</h4>
      <p>Cookies are a valuable tool for advertising one’s services and products. We also employ this tactic, to keep up with the competition and know what you like most. Cookies help us monitor your preferences, research and build up adequate statistic data to make your experience one that you will want to get back to.</p>

      <h4>DON’T WANT TO USE COOKIES?</h4>

      <p>Not a problem. We do not force this on anyone, it’s just not how it works. Every browser has the ability to limit Cookie use for every site you visit. Every major web browser has its own Cookie Management protocols. You can find them at their respective websites below:</p>

      <li>
  Google Chrome
      </li>
      <li>
  Mozilla Firefox
      </li>
      <li>
  Opera
      </li>
      <li>
  Internet Explorer
      </li>
      <li>
  Safari
      </li>
      <li>
  Android Browser
      </li>

      <p>If you happen to have a browser not listed here, please refer to their documentation and user manuals.</p>

      <p>To either delete or restrict the use of Cookies you simply need to go to your browser’s settings, then hit the Privacy section. There you can manage your use of Cookies. You can disable third party Cookies from Google Analytics as well, just visit their website, it’s all there.</p>

      <p>You can also choose not to see interest-based ads by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance. You can tweak your iPhone or iPad settings to disable interest based ads as well.</p>

      <p>Please note that disabling Cookie may drastically change your experience with certain websites, and not necessarily to the best, or even restrict you access. The website will no longer remember you as a registered visitor, you’ll need to log in again and again, and the security will be loosened as well.</p>
