  REVISION POLICY
      </h2>
      <p>Our company recognizes the fact that customers may need updates to change their orders to provide the highest quality service they want in doing so. And we wanted to let you know how it all works, hence, the strategy of revision.</p>

      <p>Our customers may request that a document be updated to our system free of charge as many times as possible for up to 10 days from the final deadline.</p>

      <p>The revision terms are listed below:</p>
      <li>Initial instructions will correspond with the instructions for final revision. Otherwise, a customer would be expected to pay 60 percent of the original service charge to change the initial instructions.</li>
      <li>When a client wants to request a revision, this can be accomplished either by email, via a personal account on our website, or by telephone. Nonetheless, we also encourage clients to send out recording messages or emails.</li>

      <li>For each order the time for free revisions is no more than 10 days from the final deadline in our program. When a customer needs more updates beyond this time period, they may require an extra charge.</li>

      <li>Unless your paper was delivered earlier, you will not have to wait until the end of the deadline to request a revision.</li>

      <li>Clients may not ask to be reassigned to a writer working on a current order, unless the client can justify the need to reassign the writer.</li>

      <li>Only after completion of one revision for urgent tasks with a limited time limit (less than 48 hours) and after completion of at least two revisions for tasks with a deadline of more than two days can a conflict be opened.</li>

      <li>The client is expected to determine the revision deadline on each separate revision request. If no deadline is stated, the customer can expect to receive the revised paper no less than 24 hours after receipt of revision instructions.</li>

      <li>When a customer has conflicts that are unresolved, he or she loses the right to free revisions.</li>

      <p>Having complete satisfaction of our customers as our primary target, we always seek to produce the final service that fulfills our customers&#39; needs without exception.</p>
